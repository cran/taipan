Description: A tool to help create shiny apps for selecting and annotating 
    elements of images. Users must supply images, questions, and answer
    choices. The user interface is a dynamic shiny app, that displays the images
    and questions and answer choices. The data generated can be saved to a
    file that can be used for subsequent analysis. The original purpose was to
    annotate still images from tennis video for face recognition and emotion 
    detection purposes.
